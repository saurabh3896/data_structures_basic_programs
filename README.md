This repository contains basic cpp programs like breadth first search, depth first search, minimum spanning tree using 
prim and kruskal's algorithm, binary search tree which are basic building block programs of data structures.
It also contains one java program which nearly acts as a code parser and finds the data type of the variables in a 
.java file using regex.pattern and regex.matcher.
